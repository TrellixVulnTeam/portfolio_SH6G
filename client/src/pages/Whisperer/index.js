                        <br />In the process of meeting and knowing people every day, I am always curious, if I were them, and replaced by their life background and environment, what kind of person would I become? What's their thoughts about this world and how they are defining themselves are very interesting to me.
                        <br />Before starting this project, I randomly selected twelve female friends for interviews. Some are friends of mine, some are I met online. Because this interview was anonymous so the interviewees were very relaxed.
                        <br />Every interviewer has chosen one quote that she think could represent her attitude of her life. After the interview, I took a picture of her portrait and use watercolour to draw her portrait to present the feeling that she gave me.</h6>
